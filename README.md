# Project 3 - Interactive Form
 Interactive Form

This project uses JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."
Customized and conditional behavior / interactivity were added, and the form validates user input and provides helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
